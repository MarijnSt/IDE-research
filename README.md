# My IDE

I've chosen [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) as my text editor.

A friend of mine recommended this one to me after I told him I used Brackets. Both are easy to use but after using them for a while, Sublime has my preference.
I really like al of the different shortcuts you can use to speed up coding stuff.

The main reason I'm going to keep using this one is because I'm already used to it. After reading a bit online, it doesn't look like a bad choice so I would like to keep learning how to use it.

## Some positives
**Multiple cursors**

You can place multiple cursors in the document if you want to add the same code in different places.
For example: if you want to add the same class to a number of elements, you can do it in one go instead of doing it one by one.

**Multiple selections**

There are a couple of ways to select the same word(s) in the document.
For Mac you can use CMD + D to select the next instance of your original selection and you can use CMD + CTRL + G to select every instance of it.

**Lightweight and fast**

Sublime is really easy to use and apparantly very fast compared to it's competitors. It handles large files really well and I like the feel of it.
I don't really have a lot of other IDE's to compare it to but I've used Brackets and Visual Studio before and Sublime feels faster and easier to use.

## Some negatives
**Not *really* free**

You can use it for free but if you save a file multiple times, you'll get a pop-up that asks you to upgrade to the paid version.
It's no problem to ignore this message but it can be annoying sometimes.

**Steep learning curve**

You can do a lot of things in Sublime and there are a lot of usefull shortcuts but you'll have to do some digging to find them.

&nbsp;

**UI is a bit dull**

It's not the most important aspect of an application but I do feel that Sublime is a bit basic in it's UI.
